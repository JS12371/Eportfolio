<h2>Philosophy Statement</h2>

<p>
When I first began programming, I was fascinated by how clearly machines interpret the world. 
Everything is rules, structure, and logic. Early frustrations with debugging simple errors, or 
struggling to understand why something broke, taught me something essential: technical skill 
alone isn’t enough. Progress requires patience, perseverance, and an ability to approach 
problems with composure.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my academic journey in computer science and data science, those values became 
non-negotiable. Managing two majors at once has been challenging, and the most difficult days 
often became the most transformative ones. Through those experiences, I learned to “abstract” 
problems in my own life, breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts, and maintaining 
steady, measurable progress.
</p>

<p>
Alongside diligence, I’ve learned the importance of producing consistent, high-quality work. 
Programming reinforces this truth every day. Machines don’t interpret your intentions — only the 
instructions you give them. Because of this, I’ve developed the habit of outlining problems 
clearly, drafting structured approaches, testing systematically, and iterating until the solution is 
sound.
</p>

<p>
These values shape how I approach every project I take on. I see technology as a tool for meaningful progress, 
and I believe disciplined improvement 
is what allows that progress to last. As I move toward my professional career, my goal is to 
continue creating work that is efficient, reliable, and thoughtful, and to solve problems with both 
creativity and rigor.

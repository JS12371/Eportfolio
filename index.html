    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome — my name is <strong>Jonah Smith</strong>, and I’m a senior at the University of Pittsburgh 
            studying <strong>Computer Science</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, 
            and <strong>Applied Statistics</strong>. I’m passionate about using data, algorithms, 
            and experimentation to solve real-world problems, especially in technology, financial markets, 
            and digital intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic journey grew out of a challenge familiar to many students: balancing a demanding STEM 
            curriculum while trying to build meaningful experience early in my career. Instead of treating 
            coursework and personal projects as separate tracks, I merged them — turning class concepts into 
            working models, research replications, and applied software tools. This approach helped me grow 
            technically while strengthening my interest in quantitative work, machine learning, and financial modeling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I’ve built data systems and automation pipelines as a 
            <strong>Software Developer and Data Analyst Intern at Federal Specialized Services</strong>, developing 
            tools for large-scale data processing, legal/regulatory workflows, and internal reporting. 
            These opportunities allowed me to apply my programming and analytical skills in real environments 
            and reinforced my interest in building systems that help people make better decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking ahead, I believe learning compounds — every project teaches something that opens the door 
            to the next. Becoming skilled in any domain takes patience, curiosity, and deliberate practice, 
            and that philosophy guides how I approach my academic, professional, and personal development. 
            Through this portfolio, I share a snapshot of my work and the foundation I’m continuing to build 
            as I work toward a career at the intersection of computing, analytics, and problem-solving.

    <!-- COVER LETTER -->

        <h2>General Professional Cover Letter</h2>

        <p>
            Dear Reader,
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to explore my professional portfolio. My name is Jonah Smith, and I am 
            a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, 
            with a minor in Applied Statistics. My academic work, personal projects, and professional experiences 
            all stem from a simple motivation: I enjoy using data, computation, and experimentation to understand 
            the world — and then improve it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my undergraduate years, I’ve built a path defined by both discipline and curiosity. 
            Balancing a demanding course load with research, software development, and personal passion projects 
            has taught me how to adapt, prioritize, and build momentum under pressure. Instead of choosing 
            between academic rigor and independent learning, I combined the two — transforming coursework 
            concepts into personal experiments in markets, equities, synthetic data modeling, and long-term 
            machine-learning research replication projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I’ve applied these skills as a Software Developer and Data Analyst Intern at 
            Federal Specialized Services, where I built and deployed tools that supported regulatory work, 
            automated complex data pipelines, and assisted attorneys by developing conditional data extraction 
            systems. These experiences strengthened my foundation in Python, SQL, data engineering, and analytical 
            reasoning while reinforcing my passion for designing tools that streamline decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside the classroom, I maintain strong personal interests in financial markets, quantitative investing, 
            music, and strength training. I’ve been playing guitar for over three years and enjoy learning new songs 
            and improvising in my free time. Powerlifting is another major part of my life, and I love the process of 
            pushing myself, setting goals, and seeing steady progress over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I continue advancing into the professional world, I aim to build on these experiences — leveraging 
            my statistical background, computational skills, and appetite for learning to contribute to data-driven 
            teams and impactful technology. I am committed to continuous growth, and I look forward to building 
            meaningful work in the years ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sincerely,<br>
            <strong>Jonah Smith</strong>
        </p>

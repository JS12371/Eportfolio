    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Welcome — my name is <strong>Jonah Smith</strong>, and I’m a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying 
        <strong>Computer Science</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, and <strong>Applied Statistics</strong>. 
        I’m passionate about using data, algorithms, and experimentation to solve real-world problems, 
        especially in technology, financial markets, and digital intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
        My academic journey grew out of a challenge familiar to many students: balancing a demanding STEM curriculum 
        while trying to build meaningful experience early in my career. Instead of treating coursework and personal 
        projects as separate tracks, I merged them — turning class concepts into working models, research replications, 
        and applied software tools. This helped me grow technically while strengthening my interest in quantitative work, 
        machine learning, and financial modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Professionally, I’ve built data systems and automation pipelines as a 
        <strong>Software Developer and Data Analyst Intern at Federal Specialized Services</strong>, developing 
        tools for large-scale data processing, legal/regulatory workflows, and internal reporting. These opportunities 
        allowed me to apply my programming and analytical skills in real environments and reinforced my interest 
        in building systems that help people make better decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside the classroom, I’m deeply interested in financial markets, quantitative investing, music, and strength 
        training. I’ve played guitar for over three years now, mostly as a way to relax and create something for myself. 
        Powerlifting is a big part of my routine as well — it keeps me grounded, gives me structure, and is something 
        I genuinely look forward to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking ahead, I believe learning compounds — every project teaches something that opens the door to the next. 
        Becoming skilled in any domain takes patience, curiosity, and deliberate practice, and that philosophy guides how 
        I approach my academic, professional, and personal development. Through this portfolio, I share a snapshot of my work 
        and the foundation I’m continuing to build as I work toward a career at the intersection of computing, analytics, 
        and problem-solving.

<h2>General Professional Cover Letter</h2>

<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to explore my professional portfolio. My name is Jonah Smith, and I am 
a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, 
with a minor in Applied Statistics. My academic work, personal projects, and professional experiences 
all stem from a simple motivation: I enjoy using data, computation, and experimentation to understand 
the world — and then improve it.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my undergraduate years, I’ve built a path defined by both discipline and curiosity. 
Balancing a demanding course load with research, software development, and personal passion projects 
has taught me how to adapt, prioritize, and build momentum under pressure. Instead of choosing 
between academic rigor and independent learning, I combined the two — transforming coursework 
concepts into personal experiments in markets, equities, synthetic data modeling, and long-term 
machine-learning research replication projects.
</p>

<p>
Professionally, I’ve applied these skills as a Software Developer and Data Analyst Intern at 
Federal Specialized Services, where I built and deployed tools that supported regulatory work, 
automated complex data pipelines, and assisted attorneys by developing conditional data extraction 
systems.
</p>

<p>
Outside the classroom, I’m deeply interested in financial markets, quantitative investing, music, 
and strength training. I’ve played guitar for over three years now, mostly as a way to relax and 
create something for myself. Powerlifting is a big part of my routine as well — it keeps me grounded, 
gives me structure, and is something I genuinely look forward to.
</p>

<p>
As I continue advancing into the professional world, I aim to build on these experiences — leveraging 
my statistical background, computational skills, and appetite for learning to contribute to data-driven 
teams and impactful technology. I am committed to continuous growth, and I look forward to building 
meaningful work in the years ahead.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Jonah Smith</strong></p>
